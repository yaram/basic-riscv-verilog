# Basic RISC-V Verilog
**Warning: This is basically the first thing I've ever made in Verilog. Don't use this as a reference for good Verilog style. It's probably terrible.**

A basic implementation of the RV32I ISA in Verilog with a testbench and a test ROM.

Requires an llvm/clang build with the experimental riscv32 target enabled to build the ROM.
